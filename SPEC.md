## Abstract

**EGAP** (the Engine Governed Agents Protocol) is an open wire protocol for governed communication between an orchestration **Engine** and one or more AI **Agents**. It defines the message formats, governance metadata, approval flow, audit semantics, and budget enforcement required for production-grade, accountable agentic systems in regulated and sovereign environments.

EGAP brings discipline to AI agents. Every message carries identity, permission scope, audit correlation, time context, and budget state. Every destructive action triggers a mandatory human approval checkpoint. Every decision is recorded immutably.

EGAP is complementary to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols. MCP governs how large language models access tools. A2A governs how peer agents exchange messages. EGAP governs how an orchestration engine dispatches, monitors, and audits agent actions — with identity, authorization, approvals, audit, and alerts enforced at the wire level.

The acronym EGAP is the permanent brand. In engineering contexts, EGAP unpacks as **Engine Governed Agents Protocol**. In enterprise contexts, EGAP is referred to as **Enterprise Governance for Agents Protocol**. In regulatory contexts, EGAP is read as **Evidence-based Governance for AI Protocols**. All expansions describe the same specification; see [EXPANSIONS.md](./EXPANSIONS.md) for the full positioning guidance.

## Status of This Document

This is a working draft of EGAProtocol v0.1. It is published for community review and reference implementation. The protocol is not yet ratified. Breaking changes are possible between v0.1 and v1.0. All changes will be tracked in CHANGELOG.md and proposed through the EGAProtocol Improvement Proposal (EIP) process defined in GOVERNANCE.md.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Production deployment of AI agents in regulated industries — banking, healthcare, government, defense, critical infrastructure — requires more than context passing and tool invocation. It requires:

- Cryptographically verifiable identity for every user and every agent session
- Role-based authorization scoped to the minimum required privilege
- Mandatory human-in-the-loop approval for destructive actions
- Immutable audit trails compliant with regulatory frameworks
- Runtime budget enforcement to prevent unbounded agentic loops
- Operational alerts when an agent deviates from expected behavior

Existing agent protocols focus on capability exchange. EGAP focuses on governance. An orchestration engine implementing EGAP can enforce governance policies uniformly across all agents, regardless of the agent's internal reasoning model or toolset.

This is the discipline that makes autonomous AI agents acceptable in environments where the cost of an uncontrolled action is measured in millions, in lives, in national security, or in public trust.

### 1.2 Design Principles

### 1.2 Design Principles

EGAP follows these principles:

- **Governance by default.** Governance metadata is mandatory on every agentic action, not optional. There is no "unauthenticated mode," no "skip audit" flag, no "approval bypass."
- **Transport-agnostic.** The protocol is defined abstractly and bound to multiple transports. v0.1 specifies canonical bindings for JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket and gRPC over HTTP/2.
- **Schema-first.** Every message is validated against a formal schema before dispatch.
- **Sovereignty-compatible.** The protocol makes no assumption of internet connectivity, cloud APIs, or managed services. Fully implementable in air-gapped environments.
- **Composable.** EGAP coexists with MCP, A2A, and OpenTelemetry. It does not replace them.
- **Universally implementable.** Both bindings are designed for minimal dependencies and implementability in any mainstream programming language.
- **Audience-neutral at the specification layer.** Although EGAP is positioned differently to engineers, enterprises, regulators, and the open-source community (see [EXPANSIONS.md](./EXPANSIONS.md)), the specification itself is a single neutral technical artifact.

### 1.3 Scope

EGAP defines:

- Wire format for Engine-to-Agent communication
- Governance metadata schema carried on every message
- Approval request/response flow
- Audit event schema
- Budget declaration and enforcement semantics
- Error model
- Session lifecycle
- Conformance criteria for certified implementations

EGAP does NOT define:

- How agents reason internally
- Which LLM providers agents use
- Tool invocation protocols between agents and tools (see MCP)
- Peer-to-peer agent communication (see A2A)
- Storage or retention policies for audit events
- User interface for approvals
- Commercial licensing of implementations

---

## 2. Conformance Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

---

## 3. Terminology

**Engine** — The orchestration component that dispatches actions to agents, enforces governance policies, and records audit events. An Engine MUST implement all five pillars of governance defined in Section 8.

**Agent** — A software component that executes actions on behalf of the Engine. An Agent MAY use an LLM internally but this is not required by the protocol.

**Action** — A single unit of work dispatched from the Engine to an Agent. Every Action has an identifier, a schema, a permission class, and a budget.

**Session** — A bounded interaction between a User and the Engine, containing one or more Actions. Sessions have identity, state, and audit correlation.

**User** — The human principal on whose behalf the Engine operates. A User has an identity, role, and entitlements.

**Permission Class** — The governance category of an Action. EGAProtocol defines four classes: READ, WRITE, MODIFY, ADMIN. See Section 10.

**Approval Gate** — A protocol checkpoint where execution suspends until a Human Approver explicitly authorizes continuation.

**Audit Event** — An immutable, structured record of a protocol event suitable for long-term retention and regulatory review.

**Budget** — A bounded resource allocation for an Action or Session, measured in iterations, tool calls, tokens, or wall-clock time.

**Binding** — A concrete mapping of the abstract protocol onto a specific transport and serialization. v0.1 defines two normative bindings: JSON-RPC/WebSocket and gRPC/HTTP2.

---

## 4. Architectural Overview

### 4.1 Roles

EGAProtocol defines three roles:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │         USER            │
                    │  (Human Principal)      │
                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │
                     authenticates / approves
                                │
                    ┌───────────▼─────────────┐
                    │         ENGINE          │
                    │  (Orchestration Core)   │
                    │                         │
                    │  ┌───────────────────┐  │
                    │  │ Governance Layer  │  │
                    │  │  - AuthN / AuthZ  │  │
                    │  │  - Approval Gates │  │
                    │  │  - Audit Sink     │  │
                    │  │  - Budget Control │  │
                    │  │  - Alert Emit     │  │
                    │  └───────────────────┘  │
                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │
                      EGAProtocol messages
                                │
                    ┌───────────▼─────────────┐
                    │         AGENT           │
                    │  (Action Executor)      │
                    └─────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Message Flow

A typical EGAProtocol exchange:

1. Engine authenticates the Session.
2. Engine dispatches an Action to the Agent with governance metadata.
3. If the Action has permission class MODIFY or ADMIN, the Engine first emits an `ApprovalRequest` and waits for an `ApprovalResponse` from the User.
4. Agent executes the Action within the declared Budget.
5. Agent returns a Result or an Error.
6. Engine emits an AuditEvent for every state transition.
7. Engine emits Alerts when defined conditions are met.

### 4.3 Why Both Bindings

v0.1 defines two canonical bindings:

- **JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket** — optimized for browser clients, developer experience, and implementations that already speak MCP-style JSON-RPC. Human-readable, low tooling requirement.
- **gRPC over HTTP/2** — optimized for high-throughput server-to-server deployment, strong typing via Protocol Buffers, native streaming. Best for production enterprise deployments.

Implementations MAY support one or both bindings. An implementation claiming full EGAProtocol conformance MUST support at least one binding in full. Interoperability between bindings is guaranteed at the message-semantics level: the same abstract Action dispatched over either binding MUST produce identical governance and audit outcomes.

---

## 5. Transport Bindings

### 5.1 JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket

**Transport:** WebSocket (RFC 6455) over TLS 1.3.

**Default endpoint path:** `/egaprotocol/v1`

**Subprotocol identifier:** `egaprotocol.v1`

**Serialization:** UTF-8 encoded JSON conforming to JSON-RPC 2.0 (https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

**Connection lifecycle:** The WebSocket connection represents a single Session. Closing the connection terminates the Session. Reconnection establishes a new Session unless the Engine supports Session resumption (see Section 15.4).

**Message direction:** Bidirectional. Both Engine and Agent can initiate method calls. Both can emit notifications.

**Heartbeat:** Implementations MUST send WebSocket ping frames every 30 seconds during idle periods. A Session with no ping response for 90 seconds SHALL be terminated.

### 5.2 gRPC over HTTP/2

**Transport:** HTTP/2 (RFC 7540) with mandatory TLS 1.3.

**Service definition:** See Appendix B.

**Package:** `egaprotocol.v1`

**Service name:** `EGAProtocolService`

**Streaming:** All governance-carrying methods use bidirectional streaming (`stream` in both directions) to support long-running Actions, streaming results, and mid-Action approval gates.

**Connection lifecycle:** Each gRPC stream represents one Session. Closing the stream terminates the Session.

**Keepalive:** Implementations MUST configure gRPC keepalive with a maximum idle time of 60 seconds.

### 5.3 Binding Equivalence

The following table maps abstract message types to concrete bindings:

| Abstract Message | JSON-RPC Method | gRPC Method |
|---|---|---|
| `Dispatch` | `ega.dispatch` | `Dispatch` (stream) |
| `Result` | (notification) `ega.result` | (response stream) |
| `ApprovalRequest` | (notification) `ega.approval.request` | `Approval` (stream) |
| `ApprovalResponse` | `ega.approval.response` | `Approval` (stream) |
| `AuditEvent` | (notification) `ega.audit` | `AuditStream` (server stream) |
| `Alert` | (notification) `ega.alert` | `AlertStream` (server stream) |
| `HealthCheck` | `ega.health` | `HealthCheck` (unary) |
| `Cancel` | `ega.cancel` | `Cancel` (unary) |

---

## 6. Message Framing

All EGAProtocol messages share a common envelope regardless of binding:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Protocol Version            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Message ID (UUID v7)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Correlation ID              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Timestamp (RFC 3339)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Message Type                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Governance Metadata         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Payload (type-specific)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Protocol Version** — MUST be the string `"ega/0.1"` for this version.
- **Message ID** — MUST be a UUIDv7 (RFC 9562) for time-orderable uniqueness.
- **Correlation ID** — Groups related messages. An Action, its Result, its Approvals, and its Audit Events all carry the same Correlation ID. MUST be a UUIDv7.
- **Timestamp** — RFC 3339 UTC timestamp with microsecond precision.
- **Message Type** — One of the Core Message Types defined in Section 7.
- **Governance Metadata** — MUST be present on every message. Schema defined in Section 8.
- **Payload** — Message-type-specific. Schemas defined in Section 7.

Implementations MUST reject any message missing any of the above fields.

Agent MUST respond with a Result of status `CANCELLED` within 5 seconds of receiving a Cancel.

---

## 8. Governance Metadata

Every EGAProtocol message MUST carry a Governance Metadata object in its envelope. This object encodes the Five Pillars of Agentic Governance (5AG).

**Schema:**

```
governance_metadata {
    // Pillar 1: Authentication
    session_token             : string (opaque, cryptographic)
    user_identity             : UserIdentity
    agent_identity            : AgentIdentity

    // Pillar 2: Authorization
    role                      : enum { L1_OPERATOR, L2_ENGINEER, L3_ADMIN }
    entitlements              : array of string
    permission_class          : enum { READ, WRITE, MODIFY, ADMIN }

    // Pillar 3: Audit
    correlation_id            : UUIDv7
    trace_id                  : string (OpenTelemetry-compatible)
    span_id                   : string (OpenTelemetry-compatible)

    // Pillar 4: Approvals
    approval_state            : enum { NOT_REQUIRED, PENDING, GRANTED, REJECTED, EXPIRED }
    approval_evidence         : optional ApprovalResponse reference

    // Pillar 5: Alerts
    alert_channels            : array of string
}
```

- **session_token** — an opaque bearer token binding the message to an authenticated Session. MUST be revocable by the Engine.
- **role** — the User's current role in this Session. The Engine MUST evaluate authorization against this role, not the User's maximum role.
- **permission_class** — the class of the Action being dispatched or referenced. Drives whether an Approval Gate is required.
- **correlation_id** — groups all messages pertaining to one Action across its lifecycle.
- **trace_id / span_id** — OpenTelemetry W3C Trace Context for integration with existing observability stacks.

---

## 9. Authentication and Identity

### 9.1 Session Authentication

Before any Action is dispatched, the Session MUST be authenticated. EGAProtocol v0.1 specifies three acceptable Session authentication mechanisms. An Engine MUST support at least one.

- **PASETO v4 tokens** (RFC-draft-paseto) — recommended default for symmetric and asymmetric signing.
- **JWT with mandatory `exp`, `iat`, `sub`, `aud`** (RFC 7519) — permitted but PASETO is preferred due to JWT's historical algorithm confusion vulnerabilities.
- **Mutual TLS client certificates** — permitted for Agent-to-Engine authentication in air-gapped deployments.

### 9.2 Identity Records

**UserIdentity:**
- `subject_id` — stable unique identifier
- `display_name` — human-readable name
- `organization` — organizational unit
- `roles` — array of roles the User may assume
- `public_key` — cryptographic public key for approval signatures

**AgentIdentity:**
- `agent_id` — stable unique identifier for the Agent
- `version` — semantic version of the Agent implementation
- `signer` — cryptographic identity of the Agent binary (e.g., sigstore attestation reference)
- `declared_capabilities` — array of Action IDs the Agent can execute

### 9.3 Identity Continuity

Once a Session is authenticated, every subsequent message in that Session MUST carry the same `user_identity.subject_id`. Mid-Session identity changes are prohibited.

---

## 10. Authorization Model

### 10.1 Permission Classes

EGAProtocol defines four permission classes for Actions. Every Action MUST declare exactly one.

- **READ** — Action only retrieves information. No state mutation.
- **WRITE** — Action creates new state but does not modify or delete existing state.
- **MODIFY** — Action modifies existing state. Requires Approval Gate.
- **ADMIN** — Action modifies system configuration, permissions, or security-critical state. Requires Approval Gate with elevated approver role.

### 10.2 Role Tiers

EGAProtocol defines three normative role tiers. Implementations MAY define additional roles but MUST map them onto these tiers for interoperability.

- **L1_OPERATOR** — may dispatch READ and WRITE Actions only.
- **L2_ENGINEER** — may dispatch READ, WRITE, and MODIFY Actions; MODIFY requires Approval.
- **L3_ADMIN** — may dispatch all classes; ADMIN requires Approval from a second L3_ADMIN.

### 10.3 Enforcement

The Engine MUST reject Dispatch messages where the dispatching role lacks the permission class entitlement. Rejection MUST emit an AuditEvent of type `ERROR_RAISED` with category `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`.

---

## 11. Approval Flow

### 11.1 Gate Activation

When a Dispatch carries a `permission_class` of `MODIFY` or `ADMIN`, the Engine MUST:

1. Suspend Action execution.
2. Emit an `ApprovalRequest` to the User's approval channel.
3. Emit an AuditEvent of type `APPROVAL_REQUESTED`.
4. Wait for an `ApprovalResponse` or timeout.

### 11.2 Response Handling

- If `ApprovalResponse.decision` is `APPROVED`: Engine resumes Action execution and emits AuditEvent `APPROVAL_GRANTED`.
- If `REJECTED`: Engine terminates the Action, returns a Result with status `CANCELLED`, and emits AuditEvent `APPROVAL_REJECTED`.
- If `DEFERRED`: Engine suspends the Session and persists state; the approval can be resumed later via Session resumption.
- If timeout expires before any response: Engine treats as implicit `REJECTED`.

### 11.3 Approver Authentication

The `ApprovalResponse.signature` MUST be a cryptographic signature over the canonical serialization of the ApprovalResponse payload (excluding the signature field itself) using the approver's private key. The Engine MUST verify the signature against the approver's `UserIdentity.public_key` before honoring the decision.

### 11.4 Non-Bypassability

Approval Gates are non-bypassable. An Engine implementation that allows MODIFY or ADMIN Actions to execute without a valid ApprovalResponse is non-conformant.

---

## 12. Audit Event Schema

### 12.1 Immutability

AuditEvents MUST be append-only. Implementations MUST NOT mutate, delete, or reorder AuditEvents after emission. Storage backends SHOULD provide cryptographic integrity guarantees (e.g., WORM storage, Merkle-tree-backed logs, or blockchain anchoring).

### 12.2 Hash Chain

Every AuditEvent in a Session carries `prior_event_hash` — the SHA-256 hash of the immediately preceding AuditEvent. The first AuditEvent in a Session MUST carry `prior_event_hash` set to 32 zero bytes. This forms a verifiable append-only chain per Session.

### 12.3 OpenTelemetry Compatibility

AuditEvents MAY be emitted in parallel as OpenTelemetry log records for integration with existing observability stacks. The OpenTelemetry mapping is specified in a non-normative appendix (forthcoming in v0.2).

### 12.4 Retention

EGAProtocol does not mandate retention duration. Implementations in regulated industries SHOULD retain AuditEvents for the period required by applicable regulation (e.g., 7 years for many financial services frameworks).

---

## 13. Budget Enforcement

### 13.1 Budget Object

Every Dispatch MUST carry a Budget:

```
budget {
    max_iterations     : integer  (agentic reasoning steps)
    max_tool_calls     : integer  (external tool invocations)
    max_tokens         : integer  (LLM tokens consumed)
    max_wall_clock_ms  : integer  (real-time duration)
}
```

### 13.2 Enforcement

The Agent MUST track consumption against the Budget. When any dimension is exhausted:

- Agent MUST halt Action execution.
- Agent MUST return a Result with status `TIMEOUT` (if wall-clock) or `FAILED` (other dimensions).
- Engine MUST emit an Alert of category `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`.
- Engine MUST emit an AuditEvent of type `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`.

### 13.3 Engine-Side Enforcement

The Engine MUST independently track wall-clock time and terminate Actions exceeding `max_wall_clock_ms` via Cancel, regardless of Agent cooperation.

---

## 14. Error Model

### 14.1 Structured Errors

Errors MUST be returned as structured objects, never as free-text strings.

```
error {
    code           : enum ErrorCode
    message        : string (human-readable)
    retryable      : boolean
    correlation_id : UUIDv7
    details        : optional map<string, any>
}
```

### 14.2 Error Codes

Normative error codes for v0.1:

| Code | Meaning | Retryable |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | Session not authenticated | No |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED` | Session token expired | No (reauthenticate) |
| `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` | Role lacks permission class | No |
| `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` | Action requires Approval Gate | No |
| `APPROVAL_REJECTED` | Human approver rejected | No |
| `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` | No ApprovalResponse within expiry | No |
| `SCHEMA_INVALID` | Parameters fail schema validation | No |
| `ACTION_UNKNOWN` | Agent does not declare this Action | No |
| `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` | Budget consumed before completion | No |
| `TOOL_HALLUCINATED` | Agent attempted to call undeclared tool | No |
| `INTERNAL_AGENT_ERROR` | Agent failure, details in payload | Yes |
| `ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE` | Engine cannot service request | Yes |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Request rate exceeds policy | Yes (with backoff) |

### 14.3 Error-Triggered Audit

Every error MUST cause emission of an AuditEvent of type `ERROR_RAISED` carrying the full error object.

---

## 15. Session Lifecycle

### 15.1 States

A Session progresses through defined states:

```
  CREATED → AUTHENTICATED → ACTIVE → SUSPENDED → ACTIVE → TERMINATED
                                  ↘
                                  APPROVAL_PENDING → ACTIVE
```

### 15.2 Creation

Session creation MUST emit an AuditEvent of type `SESSION_STARTED` carrying the full identity context.

### 15.3 Termination

Session termination MUST emit an AuditEvent of type `SESSION_ENDED`. Termination reasons include explicit close, timeout, security policy violation, or transport failure.

### 15.4 Resumption

Implementations MAY support Session resumption after disconnection. Resumption requires:

- Original session_token remains valid.
- Engine has persisted Session state at a checkpoint.
- Resumption produces an AuditEvent of type `SESSION_RESUMED` linked to the original Session via Correlation ID.

---

## 16. Security Considerations

### 16.1 Transport Security

All EGAProtocol traffic MUST be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or later. Implementations MUST reject TLS 1.2 and earlier.

### 16.2 Token Handling

Session tokens MUST NOT be logged in plaintext. Implementations MUST redact tokens in AuditEvents, storing only a cryptographic hash for correlation.

### 16.3 Replay Protection

Message IDs (UUIDv7) MUST be monotonically ordered per Session. Engines MUST reject messages with Message IDs predating the most recently received message in a Session by more than 5 seconds (to account for clock skew).

### 16.4 Hallucinated Tool Calls

When an Agent attempts to dispatch an Action not in its declared capabilities, the Engine MUST reject with error code `TOOL_HALLUCINATED` and emit an Alert of category `HALLUCINATION_DETECTED`.

### 16.5 Approval Signature Forgery

Implementations MUST verify ApprovalResponse signatures against registered public keys. Unverified approvals MUST be treated as `REJECTED`.

### 16.6 Supply Chain

AgentIdentity SHOULD include a signer attestation (e.g., sigstore) allowing the Engine to verify the Agent binary provenance at Session start.

### 16.7 Air-Gap Compatibility

EGAProtocol makes no outbound network assumptions. Implementations MUST function in environments with no internet connectivity.

---

## 17. Versioning and Compatibility

### 17.1 Version Identifier

The Protocol Version field (`ega/<major>.<minor>`) identifies the version of this specification.

### 17.2 Compatibility Rules

- Minor versions (0.1 → 0.2) MAY add new message types, new fields, new error codes. Implementations SHOULD ignore unknown fields and message types.
- Major versions (0.x → 1.0 → 2.0) MAY break compatibility. Implementations MUST NOT assume cross-major compatibility.
- v0.x is explicitly pre-stable. Breaking changes between v0.1 and v1.0 are possible.

### 17.3 Negotiation

Engines MUST respond to HealthCheck with their supported protocol versions. Agents SHOULD negotiate to the highest mutually supported version.

---

## 18. Relationship to Other Protocols

### 18.1 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP governs how an LLM-backed agent accesses external tools. EGAProtocol operates at a higher layer: it governs how an Engine dispatches work to an Agent, where that Agent may internally use MCP to access tools. An EGAProtocol-conformant Engine MAY dispatch Actions to an Agent that internally speaks MCP to its toolchain. MCP and EGAProtocol are complementary.

### 18.2 Agent-to-Agent (A2A)

A2A governs peer agent communication. EGAProtocol governs orchestration engine to agent communication. An Engine MAY coordinate multiple Agents that speak A2A among themselves, while the Engine's relationship with each Agent remains governed by EGAProtocol.

### 18.3 OpenTelemetry

EGAProtocol AuditEvents are compatible with OpenTelemetry log and trace semantics via the `trace_id` / `span_id` fields. Implementations MAY emit AuditEvents as OpenTelemetry records in parallel.

### 18.4 OAuth 2.0 / OIDC

EGAProtocol Session authentication accepts OAuth 2.0 / OIDC tokens as a valid bearer mechanism, provided the token itself meets the integrity requirements of Section 9.

---

## 19. Conformance Criteria

An implementation claims EGAProtocol v0.1 conformance by satisfying:

**C1. Transport.** Implement at least one of JSON-RPC/WebSocket or gRPC/HTTP2 bindings per Section 5.

**C2. Core Messages.** Correctly emit and process all Core Message Types in Section 7.

**C3. Governance Metadata.** Include Governance Metadata on every outbound message; validate it on every inbound message.

**C4. Authentication.** Support at least one Section 9.1 mechanism; reject unauthenticated Dispatch.

**C5. Authorization.** Enforce the permission class model of Section 10.

**C6. Approval Gates.** Enforce non-bypassable Approval Gates per Section 11 for MODIFY and ADMIN classes.

**C7. Audit.** Emit AuditEvents per Section 12 including hash chain.

**C8. Budget.** Enforce Budgets per Section 13 at both Agent and Engine.

**C9. Errors.** Use structured error model of Section 14.

**C10. Transport Security.** Enforce TLS 1.3 per Section 16.1.

A conformance test suite is under development in `egaprotocol/conformance`.
